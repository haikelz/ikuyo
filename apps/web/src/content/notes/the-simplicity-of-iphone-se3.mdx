In December 2024, I decided to use a Sony phone again. The reason was simple: size. I’ve always preferred compact phones. I like devices that are easy to hold, easy to pocket, and comfortable to use with one hand. At that time, I wanted something practical and minimal — not a giant slab of glass. I ended up using the Sony for exactly one year, from December 2024 to December 2025.

At first, everything felt fine. The form factor was perfect for me. Lightweight. Compact. Straightforward. For my usage — messaging, maps, notes, light browsing — it made sense. But over time, reality started to catch up.

## Harsh Reality Using Old-Compact Phone

Modern apps are heavier than they used to be. Updates assume stronger hardware. And unfortunately, the Sony I used was no longer powerful enough to handle today’s software comfortably. The breaking point was WhatsApp. There were moments when I had to wait tens of minutes just to load media-heavy chats or sticker packs. Opening certain conversations became frustrating. It wasn’t just occasional lag — it started affecting daily communication. Messaging should be instant. It’s basic functionality. When even that becomes slow, the device turns into friction. That’s when I realized that even though I loved the size, performance had become the bottleneck. So in December 2025, I switched.

## Why I Chose the iPhone SE 3

I chose the iPhone SE 3 for one main reason: compact size with serious performance. The size still matches my preference. It’s comfortable for one-handed use. It fits naturally in any pocket. In today’s market, that’s surprisingly rare. The biggest upgrade compared to my Sony experience is performance. Apps open instantly. WhatsApp loads without delay.  
Switching between apps feels smooth and predictable. After a year of subtle but constant delays, this feels like a major improvement — not because of flashy features, but because everything simply works.

## Camera and Daily Usage

The camera setup is simple: one rear lens. And for me, that’s enough. Photos are sharp, colors look natural, and results are consistent. I don’t really need ultra-wide lenses or extreme zoom.

For daily use like messaging, browsing, taking photos, listening to music, the SE 3 feels balanced. Meanwhile, my Sony phone hasn’t been completely retired. I still use it mostly as a music device. In that role, it works perfectly fine.

## Closing Thoughts

Using the Sony for a year wasn’t a mistake. It reminded me why I prefer compact phones. But it also taught me something important: there’s a difference between choosing simplicity and tolerating unnecessary friction. Right now, I don’t see any modern smartphone that matches the iPhone SE 3 in terms of compact size combined with strong performance. Most devices today are simply too big. And so far, I’m completely comfortable with that decision.
