description: Exploring and do some basic HTTP benchmarking using wrk

Alhamdulillah. After a while, I can write another technical note in English. In this opportunity, we will explore and do some basic HTTP benchmarking using `wrk`.

## So, What is `wrk`?

`wrk` is a modern, highly scalable HTTP benchmarking tool designed to measure the performance of Web Servers and Applications. There are some other tools that can be used for HTTP benchmarking, but I decided to pick `wrk` because it's easy to use.

## How to benchmark?

You can follow this step-by-step to benchmarking your API:

1. First, make sure that you already have the project that you want to test.
2. Install `wrk` based on your Operating Systems(OS). In this case, I install the `wrk` package in my Fedora 40:

   ```
   sudo dnf copr enable getpagespeed/wrk && sudo dnf install wrk
   ```

   Or if you are using Ubuntu:

   ```
   sudo apt install wrk
   ```

3. After that, we can directly try `wrk`. We will do some basic benchmarking here:

   ```bash
   wrk -t6 -c30 -d30s http://localhost:5000/api/all --latency
   ```

   This command will do HTTP benchmarking using **6 Threads**, **30 Open Connections**, and running for **30 seconds**. Adjust the command with your device specification.

   **Note:**

   t = Total **Threads** that you want to use in this test

   c = **Open Connections**.

   d = **Benchmark Duration** in seconds.

   --latency = **Print the latency report** too.

## Results

Well, I do this benchmark to test Golang(Fiber) and Node JS(Express JS + Typescript) as a part of my research. The case that used for this benchmarking is load 99 Asma'ul Husna data. That's it.

As you can see, Golang is win over Node JS in term of performance.
