## Joy of Missing Out

The Joy of Missing Out (JOMO) is a concept that describes the feeling of contentment and satisfaction that comes from intentionally choosing to miss out on certain experiences or opportunities. It is the opposite of the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) that often leads to anxiety and stress.

## Why it's important?

JOMO is important because it helps us to focus on the things that are truly important to us, and to live in the moment. It also helps us to reduce anxiety and stress, and to live a more balanced life.

## Me with JOMO

To be honest, I'm a person who likes to be busy all the time. If I'm not busy, I feel like I'm not doing anything. Take a look at my Wakatime stats, you will know what I mean.

In my prime time, I can code for almost 10 - 11 hours a day and sleep with around 2 - 4 hours, sometimes I didn't sleep at all. This thing is not good for my health if I keep doing it and not a guarantee for good productivity. And because of this thing, I oftenly miss some events or activities.

Well, I can FOMO. But instead of FOMO, I choose to didn't care with that "FOMO" things and focus only on important things for my life.

## How to get out from FOMO?

Well, based on my experience, I have some tips that you can do to help you get out from FOMO :

1. Read books. It can from any genre, but I recommend you to read books that can help you to get out from FOMO. For example : I love reading manga and self-improvement books.
2. **[If you're a muslim]** : Read Qur'an, listen to murottal, and do your daily prayers. There is a good quote about balancing dunya and akhirah :

   > Work as you live forever, pray as you will die tomorrow.

3. **[If possible]** : Buy a "potato" or old phone that usable for several years of usage and use it as your daily phone. You will find that you don't need to check your phone all the time. [Refer to this note](https://ekel.dev/notes/im-back-using-a-2016-sony-phone/).

4. Strictly limit your phone-usage time. For example, I have a rule to only use my phone for less than 2 hours a day. I use time tracker to help me to track my time.
