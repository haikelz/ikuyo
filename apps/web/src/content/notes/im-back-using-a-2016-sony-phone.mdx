Recently, I've switched to using a Sony Xperia X Compact (SO-02J) from 2016 as my primary daily driver phone. Originally, this phone served as my backup device. The Sony Xperia X Compact has always impressed me with its entertainment capabilities, whether I'm listening to music or watching movies, the experience is surprisingly excellent for such a compact device. You can check out the complete specifications on [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_x_compact-8292.php) if you're curious about the technical details.

Back to the topic, why did I make this 9-year-old phone my main device? The answer is actually very simple: I love compact phones that are easy to operate with one hand. As I've reflected on my smartphone usage patterns, I've realized something important about myself. My phone usage is quite minimal and focused. No mobile gaming activities. The more I analyzed my habits, the clearer it became that I don't need the latest and greatest smartphone technology.

Well, there are some inconveniences with this setup. Since this is an ex-Japanese operator phone, the IMEI is blocked for local networks. This means I have to carry another phone (actually, my previous daily phone) for mobile data tethering. Also, the spesifications of this device is outdated now (Snapdragon 650, still using eMMC 4.5, 2700 mAh of Battery).

For adjustment, I've deleted all of unused/unnecessary bloatware from this phone. You can easily remove it using ADB. Unfortunately, I don't see any opportunities to UBL and Root this phone since this device are operator-locked.

> Doesn't that just make things more complicated for you?

I'm not glued to my phone. The majority of my day is spent working on my laptop. My phone is truly used only when necessary â€“ for quick communication, essential apps, or entertainment during breaks. So yeah, my decision comes down to a simple philosophy: "I think I need to simplify this."

By the way, here are some photos that I've taken with Xperia X Compact:

As you can see, the result pictures are still good enough for 2025, though its not as good as the newest midrange smartphone nowadays.
